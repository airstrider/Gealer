There are two exercises for technical interviews.

1.
The KeyCountTest class is an example to sum up keys in a text file. 
The file contains data in the format of "key,count" where key is a string and count is an integer. 
Each line will only contain one key-count pair. 
The output should contain each key occurring in the file along with the sum of the count for all occurrences of a given key.

Example
The input: [John,2], [Jane,3], [John,4], [Jane,5].
The output: The total for John is 6. The total for Jane is 8.


2.
The PalindromeDetection class is an example to determine if a given string is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled exactly the same forwards or backwards, like. 

Example
The input: "Ah, Satan sees Natasha".
The output: "Ah, Satan sees Natasha" is a palindrome

The input: "airstrider"
The output: "airstrider" is NOT a palindrome

For this question, ignore all non-alphanumeric characters and assume that upper-and lower- case characters are identical. 
The function should output whether or not the string is a palindrome and return a boolean.
